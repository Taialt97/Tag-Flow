## Installation

### Manual Installation

1. Download the zip file called `Tag Flow Beta`.
2. Unzip the folder.
3. Move the folder to `Your Obsidian Vault > .obsidian > Plugin`.

> **Note**: If you can't find the `.obsidian` folder, it's likely hidden.
**Mac:** Open Finder > Press Command + Shift + . (dot)
**Windows:** Open File Explorer > Click on 'View' tab > Check 'Hidden items' in the Show/hide section

## Usage

To create a new tag-based list, open the "Tag Flow: Open Tag Flow" modal via Obsidian's command palette, and then choose a tag from which to create a list. The list will be created at the mouse location.

## Known Issues

- Lists initiated at the beginning of a note don't refresh properly.
- Unexpected tags may appear within the list on Mac systems.

## Roadmap

The following are features we plan to implement in upcoming versions. Your feedback and contributions are welcome!

- **Adding All Tags List:** Create a list of all tags.
- **Adding Nested Tags:** Support tags in the format `{{nameOfNote/NameOfNote}}`, allowing nested categorization.
- **Inline Tag Headers:** Provide the ability to link inline tags to their headers.
- **Integration with Templates:** Ensure the plugin works with Obsidian's templates.
- **Anchor Support:** Enable linking to a specific tag within a document, navigating to the exact location.
- **User-Selectable List Types:** Allow users to choose different types of tag lists (Simple List, Expanded List, Front Matter Only, Simple Inline, Expanded Inline).
